# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

Except where explicitly noted otherwise, the code in this repository is
UNLICENSED. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a reference for concepts in
computer science and their implementations in TypeScript. The value is
knowledge, not a solution to be copy+pasted elsewhere. Developing this knowledge
benefits from learning the concepts and then applying them in your own code, as
has been done here.

## Development

This repo uses TypeScript for development feedback and somewhat improved
documentation. To validate the usage of types in the source, run `test:types`.
To validate continuously, run `test:types:watch`.
