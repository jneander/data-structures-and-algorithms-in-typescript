# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

Except where explicitly noted otherwise, the code in this repository is UNLICENSED. The purpose of
this repo is to serve as a reference for concepts in computer science and their implementations in
TypeScript. The value is knowledge, not a solution to be copy+pasted elsewhere. Developing this
knowledge benefits from learning the concepts and then applying them in your own code, as has been
done here.

## Development

This repo uses TypeScript for development feedback and somewhat improved documentation. To validate
the usage of types in the source, run `test:types`. To validate continuously, run
`test:types:watch`.

### prettier

To maximize consistency in code style, this repo uses prettier. To validate code style, run
`lint:prettier`. To automatically fix any prettier issues, run `lint:prettier:fix`.

### eslint

To minimize issues from problematic practices and to provide additional feedback in configured IDEs,
this repo uses eslint. To validate code against preconfigured eslint rules, run `lint:eslint`. To
automatically fix any eslint issues, run `lint:eslint:fix`.
